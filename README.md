### Summer Course 2019

- A 26 Days course Conducted in IIIT-Hyderabad and it consists of 2 courses, Systems and Apps.
	
- In the System course, we learn problem solving and implementing various applications like excel, compiler and file system from scratch.

- Entire Systems Course was in C/C++ language only.

## Implemented topics

### Day 1 - Problem Solving
This included _Sorting Techniques_, *Linked Lists*, *Matrix Operations* and *String Operations*

### Day 2 - Recursion
Classic recursion problems

### Day 3 - Excel
Implementing a small scale excel-like application with CLI from scratch

### Day 4 - Rat Maze
A **rat** starts from source and has to reach the destination. The **rat** can **move only** in **two directions**: *forward* and *down*. Some blocks of the matrix are not accessible.

### Day 5 - Memory based problem solving 
Implementing sorting methods for large scale data.

### Day 6 - FileSystem
 Implementing a small scale FileSystem application with CLI to perform CRUD operations on files, which store the data in blocks in a [hdd file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/hdd).

### Day 7 - Compiler
Implementing a small scale Compiler application with CLI. It is similar to assembly language with commands like `DATA`, `MOVE`, `IF`.
